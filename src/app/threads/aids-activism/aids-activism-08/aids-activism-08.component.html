He went around the world many times but never found himself.  He never said &lsquo;Good Night&rsquo; to someone he loved.  He never heard &lsquo;Good Morning&rsquo; from someone who loved him. </p>
                <p class="body_text">Stuart traveled alone, teaching.  Preaching to his Fire Island Congregation, reading, guiding people around New York and around the work, helping them to see the beauty he saw.&ldquo;</p>   
                <p class="body_text">My brother-in-law tried very hard to do the right thing and I liked this quality most of all.  I loved this man very much.  I&rsquo;m happy for the time I had with him and I&rsquo;m glad he was part of my life and my family.&ldquo;</p>
