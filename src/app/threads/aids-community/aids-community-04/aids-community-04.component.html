          &ldquo;I have been working with Native-American students in our area. Each student made a square representing themselves as individuals who speak with one voice in the statement, &lsquo;Help Protect the Balance â€“ Learn About AIDS.&rsquo; The Washo Medicine Wheel is displayed on The Quilt, which represents the physical, emotional, spiritual and mental aspects of a person in balance. We would be very honored if our work could join the NAMES Project and speak to all those who experience the healing power of the quilts.
