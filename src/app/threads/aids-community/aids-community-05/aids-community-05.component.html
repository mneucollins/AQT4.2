                  &ldquo;Tom and Teresa were husband and wife. Rick and Joe were neighbors from childhood.  The four lived less than 20 miles apart, yet didnâ€™t know each other. Each of their mothers has met and we&rsquo;ve formed friendships. We&rsquo;ve met at Rich&rsquo;s Mom&rsquo;s house to create and do our quilts with much love and support.  Through our grief and losses we&rsquo;ve formed friendships and found much comfort from each other.&rdquo;                </p>
