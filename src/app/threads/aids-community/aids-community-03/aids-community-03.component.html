                  &ldquo;On behalf of the students and staff at Willard Elementary School in Spokane, Washington, I would like to present this Willard quilt square in fondest memory of Kara Claypool. Kara enjoyed two years of school with us before her death in August of 1995 and we certainly enjoyed Kara. She appreciated every day, and helped us to focus on what is actually important in life. After taking her medication in the office at lunch, she always stopped to chat with me and collect a surprise. She thought it was her reward; sharing time with her was mine.&rdquo;
