The answer is:  with dignity, grace and love…just like she lived her life.  I never thought I’d see my mom on television, talking about condoms.  I’m sure she never expected to either.  A local TV station had asked to interview her about the rising incidence of the virus among heterosexual women.  She called me to ask if I was ready for her to talk about AIDS so publicly.  Was I ready?  She was ready.  That&rsquo;s all I needed to know.&rdquo;</p>
