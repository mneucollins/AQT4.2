It&rsquo;s been said that grown men don&rsquo;t cry, but you can believe me when I say that I cried and I still cry inside when I think about what has been lost.  My granddaughter and I had a marvelous relationship.  The love that engendered that relationship still endures and the dignity and strength with which she bore her affliction inspires and sustains me as I approach the winter of my life.&rdquo;</p>
