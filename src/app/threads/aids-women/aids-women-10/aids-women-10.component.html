Three years ago she graduated from the fifth grade and the most significant difference between then and now is that in 1993, her mother Erin Goldstone, was in the audience to watch.  I know that Erin was here today, too and that she will be at all the other important happenings of her daughter&rsquo;s life.  She will be with us in our hearts and in spiritâ€¦ We will remember her and love her always.&rdquo;</p>
