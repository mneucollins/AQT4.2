Together they created a panel that included Nikki&rsquo;s favorite things including her love of music, picnics in the mountains and of course, shooting hoops with Roman.  The students also planned carefully to include a shade of Nikki&rsquo;s favorite color purple in every section of the panel.</p>
                <p class="body_text">This panel is also part of the Ethnicity Thread </p><!-- I donâ€™t believe this will be the final name of this thread so not sure how to deal with this issue. I will confer with Leticia on Monday - 5/22/17 -->
