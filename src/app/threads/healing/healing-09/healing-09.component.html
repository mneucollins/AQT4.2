I watched their hands, some deft and others clumsy, some smooth and others wrinkled, every one providing service, not one needing command. For the quilting women, who did not know my son, this quilt in his memorial became what they organized their days around. They gave to it and were given to by it and by each other.</p>
                <p class="body_text">And they came to love each other and one felt that what made them able to love was the need the quilt had for their ministry.  It was at times as if the quilt were Keith himself, lying in their midst, a fallen man.&rdquo;</p>
