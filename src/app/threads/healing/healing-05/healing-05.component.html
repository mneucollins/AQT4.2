                <p class="body_text">&ldquo;Jeffrey worked with three women in the hospital where he volunteered to design his piece of the Quilt.  They were able to present it to him about one month before he died.  It was clearly his most prized possession during these last weeks.  Since Jeffâ€™s death, this Quilt piece has provided me and the members of my family much comfort as well.&rdquo;</p>
