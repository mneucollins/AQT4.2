                        <p class="body_text">&ldquo;I loved giving Ted funny, off-beat gifts and gave him his first Pig, which started a a collection of over 100 pigs many which accentuated his irreverent sense of humor…in his last house in San Francisco, he had an artist paint a wonderful mural on the ceiling of his living room, a la Sistine Chapel.  A sky of angels floated in a sea of clouds…one in the central mandala had a pig face!</p>
                        <p class="body_text">Shortly after he died, Ted came to me in a dream and gave me the first directions that began the design of the panel.  I merely &lsquo;followed orders&rsquo; as I created.  I tried to show Ted as he saw himself.  He was right there with me…laughing his hearty laugh and calling out his yeas and nays.  It was a deeply spiritual experience for me, filled with grief and completion…an intense labor of love that brought me exquisite joy.&rdquo;</p>
