As I began to design my son Mark&rsquo;s panel and lay out the pieces I felt as though it was the saddest and most beautiful experience of my life—somehow merging the pain of burying my son in October of 1986 with the joy of giving birth to him 37 years ago...All across America there are other mothers like me, as well as fathers, grandparents. Sisters, brothers, sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, lovers and friends who had found themselves &mdash; or soon will—drawn to The Quilt by the immense power of its hope and humanity.  I did it for two reasons – for Mike and for all the other who&rsquo;ve been lost to aids and for myself and all the others who&rsquo;ve lost them.&rdquo;</p>
