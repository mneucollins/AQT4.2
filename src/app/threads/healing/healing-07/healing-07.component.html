                <p class="body_text">&ldquo;This panel has been prepared for our father, Richard Gordon Simmons. The NAMES Project has given us the chance to express feelings, emotions, and experiences, which most people do not have the opportunity to share with others, especially after a loved one has physically left us.  It offers a healing process no one can understand unless they too have been touched by its tragic cause and results.</p> 
                <p class="body_text">It has taken one and a half years to get up the guts and perseverance to finish this panel.  It’s been worth all of the gathering, costs, and time to release our love for all to share.  Please enjoy the bits and pieces of our father’s life contained within this panel.  It is only a tiny part of his existence, a glimpse and reflection of his life.&rdquo;</p>
