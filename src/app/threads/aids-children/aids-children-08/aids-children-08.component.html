                <p class="body_text">&ldquo;Beatriz got pregnant and contracted HIV/AIDS at the same time. I met her right after she was diagnosed and helped her to die with dignity and love. Her baby (1 1/2 years old) was diagnosed with AIDS right before she died, and she was very worried about his future. His aunt and my family took little Freddy into our hearts and lives, and he became a wonderful part of our family. With love and good food and care, he has lived for 17 years, defying the doctors&rsquo; prediction that he would be dead in 6 months. Beatriz must be smiling down from Heaven right now to know her little son has done so well.</p>
                <p class="body_text">I made this quilt block for Beatriz, and also to honor all the women who pass HIV/AIDS onto their unborn babies. As a midwife, I teach all over the world on the prevention of Mother-to-Child-Transmission of HIV/AIDS. Women and children are an important part of the AIDS story, and deserve to be honored in the Quilt.</p>
                <p class="body_text">Blessings to all of you who dedicate your lives to keep the stories alive.&rdquo;</p>
