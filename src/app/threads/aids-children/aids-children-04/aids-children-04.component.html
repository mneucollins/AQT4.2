She was becoming more comfortable knowing soon there would be no more pain…One day before Candace died, we celebrated her 6th birthday in the hospital inviting hospital staff, family and friends.. Candace always loved her birthdays and this one was going to be special, because it was going to be the last we would celebrate together.</p>
