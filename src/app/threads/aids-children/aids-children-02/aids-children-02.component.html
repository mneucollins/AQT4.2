                  &ldquo;I am a biochemist involved in AIDS-related viral research, as well as a mother.  I have dedicated my Quilt squares to all the AIDS babies.  I made this panel from diapers and receiving blankets that were my own infant son&rsquo;s.  He is completely healthy â€“ for which I am both thankful and slightly guilt-ridden.  So many babies are not.  Science moves slowly.  Patience is a necessity.  But please, know that we are doing the best that we can.&rdquo;
