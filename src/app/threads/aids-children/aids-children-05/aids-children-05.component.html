Annie stood by her to the bitter end.  Tavorius was a beautiful two year-old that loved to go to church and is best remembered clapping his little hands and singing ‘Halle’lujah.’  He was a healthy happy little boy who got sick and died so quickly.  Once he was gone, his mother was ready to join him.”&rdquo;</p>
